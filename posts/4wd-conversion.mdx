## tl;dr

* Overpaid for an oil leaking BMW that I learned to fix up.

## The Car

The car ran and drove perfectly fine from the day I bought it (April 1, 2020), until 
tearing up the engine bay sometime in January 2022. There were a few (should have been obvious) problems
I didn't notice until gaining confidence behind the wrench from my 2007 Tacoma 4wd conversion.

* Cracked crankcase ventilation (CCV) tube sealed up with duck tape
* Oil dripping near the oil filter housing gasket, and the aluminum splash guard
