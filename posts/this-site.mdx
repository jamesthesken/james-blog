## This Site's Purpose
It's amazing how quickly my ability to write atrophies after extended breaks. I built this site to take a deeper dive
into web-development, improve my writing skills, and share solutions to problems I face.  

One of my long-standing goals is to be self-employed, either running my own businesses or freelancing. At first, this was born out of 
the desire for independence, "working for yourself", etc.. 

However after two years of building my first business, I found these to be the *least* fulfilling aspects.
This paragraph is turning cliche but it rings true for me. It is more rewarding to work with others, understand their problems, and work to solve them as 
quick as possible. Probably an eye roll for most but that's okay. 

This blog is a way to form a habit around this concept. Sharing information on the internet and hopefully helping others along the way,
instead of working alone.


## How I Built this Site
This site started as a learning project to better learn Tailwind CSS and my favorite React framework, Next.js.

I chose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because it's easy to implement server side rendering, routing, and Typescript.

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) let's you write blog posts (and other cool stuff) using Markdown.

This site is [open source!](https://github.com/jamesthesken/james-blog)
