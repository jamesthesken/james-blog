## Headings

To create a heading, add one to six <kbd>#</kbd> symbols before your heading text. The number of <kbd>#</kbd> you use will determine the size of the heading.

```markdown
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading
```

When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents which you can access by clicking \{% octicon "list-unordered" aria-label="The unordered list icon" %} within the file header. Each heading title is listed in the table of contents and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.
